# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I learned about Unity and C # since 2019, taking several courses on game development, such as  2D platformers, RPG games, and also mouse-controlled 3D games.

because I was excited to develop a game, I decided to develop my own game. but apparently the game that I imagined I'd build turned out to be too big. I knew it when I try to develop it.

therefore starting 2020, I started making simple games for cellphones and started marketing them. I hope this journey continues until I achieved my Dream. I am a great game developer in the making.
